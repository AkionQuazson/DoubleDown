            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <p>Setup: (The app will automatically set up the game based on the players provided)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shuffle two standard decks of cards together (including all 4 jokers).</li>
                <li>Deal 8 cards to each player, set them in a 2x4 grid, then turn 2 of those cards faceup. (Done randomly in app)</li>
                <li>Discard the top card of the deck</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Gameplay:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Players take turns. At the beginning of your turn, draw a card from the deck or discard. (In the app, click on either the facedown or faceup card in the middle of the screen)</li>
                <li>Use the card you drew to replace one of the cards in your grid. (In the app, click on the related card)</li>
                <li>If two faceup cards are across from each other (the same column), both cards are locked, and can't be replaced.</li>
                <li>If you draw a card that matches a faceup card in your grid, you can stack the matching cards, then flip the facedown card from across onto the match and discard all three! Double Down!</li>
                <li>If you don't want to put the card you drew in your grid (or double down), you can discard it. (In the app, click the center area, including the deck or discard)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Game End:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When a player starts their turn with all cards removed or locked, the game ends.</li>
                <li>Each player who still has facedown cards turns those cards faceup.</li>
                <li>The player with the lowest score wins. (Numbers are worth their value, Q and J are worth 10, K is worth 0, A is worth 1, and W is worth -3)</li>
            </ul>
